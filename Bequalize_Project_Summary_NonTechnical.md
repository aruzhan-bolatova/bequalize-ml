# Bequalize Belt Project - Non-Technical Summary

## What is the Bequalize Belt?

The Bequalize Belt is a **smart wearable device** designed to help healthcare professionals assess and treat **balance disorders** and **vestibular (inner ear) problems**. Think of it as a high-tech belt that patients wear around their waist during medical assessments and therapy sessions.

### The Problem It Solves

Many people suffer from balance problems caused by inner ear disorders, which can lead to:
- **Dizziness and vertigo** (feeling like the room is spinning)
- **Increased fall risk**, especially in elderly patients
- **Balance instability** during daily activities
- **Breathing difficulties** related to anxiety from balance issues

Currently, diagnosing these conditions requires expensive clinical equipment and subjective assessments. The Bequalize Belt makes this process **more objective, accessible, and accurate**.

## What Data Does the Belt Collect?

### üîß **Physical Sensors**

1. **Motion Sensors (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)**
   - **What they measure**: Body tilt, rotation, and movement in 3D space
   - **Why it matters**: Detects how much someone sways or tilts when trying to balance
   - **Clinical value**: Shows balance stability and postural control

2. **Breathing Sensor (Elastometer)**
   - **What it measures**: Chest expansion and contraction during breathing
   - **Why it matters**: Breathing patterns change with anxiety and balance problems
   - **Clinical value**: Monitors respiratory health and stress responses

3. **Temperature Sensor**
   - **What it measures**: Body/ambient temperature
   - **Why it matters**: Temperature can affect balance and indicates device health
   - **Clinical value**: Provides additional physiological context

4. **Device Status**
   - **Battery level**: Ensures reliable operation during assessments
   - **Button presses**: Allows patients to mark specific events or symptoms
   - **Connection quality**: Ensures data reliability

### üìä **Processed Health Metrics**

The app automatically calculates:
- **Balance stability scores** (how steady someone stands)
- **Sway measurements** (how much someone moves when trying to stand still)
- **Breathing rate and quality** (breaths per minute and pattern regularity)
- **Fall risk assessment** (probability of falling)
- **Exercise performance** (how well therapy exercises are performed)
